  For data science applications: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MQDataScience/tree/main/DataScience
  For time-based correction coefficient assisted 4d ppm slope estimation in Data Science Applications: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/4D_Slope/run.py (4DSlope.py)
  For only read and estimate current ppm values with correction coefficient (does not include 4D axis features) in Data Science Applications: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/4D_Slope/readppm.py
  For 4D air quality graphical sensor simulation with time-based correction coefficient support in data science applications: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/4D_Surface/4DSurface.py
  To generate regression curves of all supported MG811 gases: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/Regression/MG811_Curves.py
  For the time-dependent Resume and Response curve of the correction coefficient: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/Response%20and%20Resume%20Curve/Response%20and%20Resume%20Curve.py
  For Theoretical CO2 analysis with the Nernst equation: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/TheoreticalCO2/TheoreticalCO2.py
  For Theoretical CO2 ppm estimation with the Nernst equation: https://github.com/abcdaaaaaaaaa/MG811DataScience/blob/main/DataScience/4D_Slope/TheoreticalCO2.py

--WARNING--
  For time-based correction coefficient assisted 4d ppm slope estimation and For Theoretical CO2 ppm estimation with the Nernst equation:
  For a brief ppm estimate, please only run "run.py". The run.py file will run 4DSlope.py and TheoreticalCO2.py in the appropriate order.
  Please replace 4D_Slope/4D_Datas.xlsx with your actual measured data.
