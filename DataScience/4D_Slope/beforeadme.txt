This code aims to predict future data based on past data. 
Please update the xlsx excel file to the past results you have obtained.
The data you need to measure for this code: Gas Sensor Percentage, Celsius Temperature, Relative Humidity (DHT22, recommended).

(1) To get All Estimation Report +  ppm results of gases + Theoretical CO2 Analysis Estimation + 4D Slope Html File run "run.py" file. (recommended)
(2) To get only All Estimation Report + ppm results of gases run "readppm.py" file.
(3) To get only All Estimation Report + Theoretical CO2 Analysis Estimation run "TheoreticalCO2.py" file.

--Necessary Files--
(1): | run.py | 4DSlope.py | TheoreticalCO2.py | 4D_Datas.xlsx |
(2): | readppm.py | 4D_Datas.xlsx |
(3): | TheoreticalCO2.py | 4D_Datas.xlsx |

--WARNING--
In (1), Theoretical CO2 Analysis Estimation results and ppm results of gases are included in the All Estimation Report.
In (2), ppm results of gases are included but Theoretical CO2 Analysis Estimation results are NOT included in the All Estimation Report.
In (3), Theoretical CO2 Analysis Estimation are included but ppm results of gases are NOT included in the All Estimation Report.
